# Project Landing Page for Odin Recipe Site
This repository contains the landing page for our Odin Recipe Site, which is a project we initiated during our participation in the Odin Project.

Project Overview
-------------
The text for the hero section and the call to action (CTA) section has been generated by ChatGPT.
All images used in this project have been generated by DALLÂ·E.
Recipe names and descriptions have been sourced from allrecipes.com.


What I Learned
-------------
HTML and CSS fundamentals: I improved my skills in HTML and CSS
CSS Flexbox: I became more comfortable with using CSS Flexbox to create responsive and flexible layouts.

Challenges Faced
-------------
Container usage: I had to make decisions about the optimal number of containers to use in certain parts of the site, and I wasn't always sure if I had used too many or too few.

Flexbox properties: Working with properties like "grow," "shrink," and "basis" in CSS Flexbox required some trial and error, and I had to do a lot of guessing to achieve the desired layouts.

Positioning: I faced difficulties in positioning elements on the page correctly.

ToDo
-------------
Make the site responsive


Version Control
-------------
During the development of the site, I used GitHub extensively for the initial version (a copy of the "solution.png"). However, as the project progressed, I inadvertently overlooked its use, resulting in only one significant commit at the end of the project.
